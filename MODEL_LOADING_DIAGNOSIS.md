# Model Loading Diagnosis

## Issue Identified

The Trade-MCP application is hanging at "Loading checkpoint shards: 0%" when trying to load the Phi-3-mini model. This issue occurs because:

1. **Model files are in safetensor format** - The model files can be opened as safetensors but have issues when loaded as PyTorch files
2. **PyTorch pickle protocol incompatibility** - There's a version mismatch between the pickle protocol used to save the model and what PyTorch expects
3. **CPU compatibility issues** - The quantization and device mapping settings may not be optimal for CPU-only systems

## Diagnosis Results

### ✅ Model Files Are Not Corrupted
- Model directory exists and contains the expected files
- Safetensor files can be opened successfully
- File sizes match expected values (2.5GB and 4.7GB)

### ⚠️ Loading Issues
- PyTorch loading fails due to pickle protocol incompatibility
- Model loading hangs at "Loading checkpoint shards: 0%"
- Even simple loading approaches experience the same issue

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Force Model Redownload
We're currently force redownloading the model with proper configuration:
- Clearing the existing cache
- Downloading fresh model files
- Using CPU-friendly settings

### 2. Updated Reasoner Configuration
Updated [trade_mcp/reasoner.py](file:///n:/autoinvestor/trade_mcp/reasoner.py) with CPU-optimized settings:
- `device_map={"": "cpu"}` to force CPU usage
- `bnb_4bit_compute_dtype=torch.float32` for better CPU compatibility
- `llm_int8_enable_fp32_cpu_offload=True` for CPU offloading

### 3. Environment Optimization
- Using local cache directory (`N:\autoinvestor\huggingface`)
- Enabled Xet Storage for faster downloads
- Proper token limits (3000 response tokens, 10k memory tokens)

## Next Steps

1. **Wait for Redownload Completion** - The force redownload is currently in progress
2. **Test Model Loading** - After redownload, test with the updated reasoner configuration
3. **Start Application** - Once confirmed working, start the Trade-MCP application

## Files Updated

1. **[trade_mcp/reasoner.py](file:///n:/autoinvestor/trade_mcp/reasoner.py)** - Updated with CPU-friendly model loading settings
2. **[force-redownload-model.py](file:///n:/autoinvestor/force-redownload-model.py)** - Script to force redownload with proper configuration
3. **[check-model-files.py](file:///n:/autoinvestor/check-model-files.py)** - Diagnostic script to verify model file integrity
4. **[diagnose-model-loading.py](file:///n:/autoinvestor/diagnose-model-loading.py)** - Comprehensive diagnostic script

## Expected Outcome

After the force redownload completes and with the updated CPU-friendly configuration, the model should load successfully without hanging at "Loading checkpoint shards: 0%". The application will then be able to generate trading recommendations using the Phi-3-mini model.
