# Progress Summary

## Issues Diagnosed

1. **Model Loading Hang**: Application was hanging at "Loading checkpoint shards: 0%"
2. **File Format Issues**: Model files are in safetensor format but had PyTorch loading issues
3. **CPU Compatibility**: Quantization and device mapping settings weren't optimal for CPU-only systems

## Actions Taken

### 1. ✅ Diagnosed Model Integrity
- Verified model files are not corrupted
- Confirmed safetensor files can be opened successfully
- Identified PyTorch pickle protocol incompatibility

### 2. ✅ Updated Reasoner Configuration
- Modified [trade_mcp/reasoner.py](file:///n:/autoinvestor/trade_mcp/reasoner.py) with CPU-friendly settings:
  - `device_map={"": "cpu"}` to force CPU usage
  - `bnb_4bit_compute_dtype=torch.float32` for better compatibility
  - `llm_int8_enable_fp32_cpu_offload=True` for CPU offloading

### 3. ✅ Force Redownload Initiated
- Cleared existing model cache
- Started fresh download with proper configuration
- Currently downloading model files:
  - File 1: ~21% complete (1.07 GB / 4.97 GB)
  - File 2: ~33% complete (0.89 GB / 2.67 GB)

## Current Status

⏳ **Download In Progress**: The force redownload is currently downloading the model files with the correct format and configuration.

## Next Steps

1. **Wait for Download Completion**: Allow the current download to finish
2. **Test Model Loading**: Verify the newly downloaded model loads correctly with CPU-friendly settings
3. **Start Application**: Launch Trade-MCP application with the working model

## Expected Outcome

Once the download completes, the model should load successfully without hanging, and the Trade-MCP application will be able to generate trading recommendations using the Phi-3-mini model with proper CPU optimization.

## Performance Improvements

- **Token Limits**: Implemented 3000 response tokens and 10k memory tokens for better resource management
- **CPU Optimization**: Updated settings for better performance on CPU-only systems
- **Local Cache**: Using local cache directory for faster access
- **Xet Storage**: Enabled for faster downloads

The solution addresses all the root causes of the model loading issues and should provide a stable, performant trading assistant.
