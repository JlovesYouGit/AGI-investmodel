# Debug Summary

## Issues Encountered

1. **Model Loading Hang**: Application hangs at "Loading checkpoint shards: 0%"
2. **Corrupted Cache Files**: Some files in the cache appear to be corrupted or in wrong format
3. **Symbolic Link Issues**: Snapshot directory contains 0-byte symbolic links

## Attempts Made

### 1. ✅ Force Redownload
- Cleared cache and redownloaded model files
- Files downloaded successfully (2.67GB and 4.97GB)
- No .incomplete extension indicates successful download

### 2. ✅ CPU Optimization
- Updated reasoner with CPU-friendly settings:
  - `device_map={"": "cpu"}`
  - `bnb_4bit_compute_dtype=torch.float32`
  - `llm_int8_enable_fp32_cpu_offload=True`

### 3. ✅ Token Limits
- Implemented 3000 response tokens and 10k memory tokens
- Improved resource management

### 4. ⏳ Complete Cache Clear and Redownload
- Currently running huggingface-cli download
- Awaiting completion

## Root Cause Analysis

The issue appears to be related to:
1. **Corrupted Model Files**: Some files in the cache are not in the expected format
2. **Symbolic Link Issues**: The snapshot directory contains broken symbolic links
3. **PyTorch Loading Problem**: PyTorch cannot properly load the checkpoint shards

## Next Steps

1. **Wait for huggingface-cli Download**: Complete the download with the official tool
2. **Test Model Loading**: Verify the model loads correctly with the fresh download
3. **Update Reasoner**: Ensure reasoner uses the correct loading parameters
4. **Start Application**: Launch Trade-MCP with the working model

## Files to Monitor

1. **Cache Directory**: `N:\autoinvestor\huggingface`
2. **Model Files**: 
   - `model-00001-of-00002.safetensors` (4.97GB)
   - `model-00002-of-00002.safetensors` (2.67GB)
3. **Reasoner**: `trade_mcp/reasoner.py`

## Expected Resolution

Once the huggingface-cli download completes with properly formatted files, the model should load successfully without hanging at "Loading checkpoint shards: 0%". The CPU-optimized settings in the reasoner should ensure good performance on CPU-only systems.
