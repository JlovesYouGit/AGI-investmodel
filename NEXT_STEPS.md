## Performance Tips

1. **Keep the Local Cache**: The model is stored locally in `N:\autoinvestor\huggingface` for faster access
2. **Use 4-bit Quantization**: Reduces memory usage while maintaining performance
3. **Xet Storage**: Enabled for faster downloads (already configured)

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues and Solutions

1. **"401 Unauthorized" Error**: 
   - Check that HF_TOKEN is set in your .env file
   - Verify the token is valid at https://huggingface.co/settings/tokens

2. **"quant_type must be nf4" Error**: 
   - Already fixed in the code, but if you see this, restart the application

3. **"Connection Error"**: 
   - Check your internet connection
   - Try again later if the Hugging Face servers are busy

4. **Slow Download**: 
   - The download uses Xet Storage for better performance
   - It will resume automatically if interrupted
