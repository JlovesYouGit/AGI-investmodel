    A[Frontend - Next.js] --> B[Backend API - NestJS]

```

## Anti-Patterns Identified

1. **Callback Pyramids**: The reasoner.py file has nested callback structures that make the code hard to follow.
2. **Hard-coded Secrets**: Default tokens in config.py that could be exposed.
3. **Mutable Global State**: Global variables like `_server_alive` and `_telegram_alive` that can cause concurrency issues.
4. **Inconsistent Error Handling**: Different error handling approaches across modules.
5. **Tight Coupling**: Direct dependencies between modules without proper interfaces.

## Migration Steps

### Phase 2: Backend Modernization (Days 1-2)
1. Create NestJS application structure
2. Implement core trading modules
3. Port AI integration to cloud-native services

2. Implement responsive UI with Tailwind CSS and shad/ui
3. Create dashboard and trading interfaces
4. Implement real-time updates with WebSocket
5. Add comprehensive component and E2E tests

### Phase 4: Infrastructure and Deployment (Days 3-4)
1. Containerize applications with multi-stage Docker builds
2. Create Kubernetes manifests and Helm charts
3. Implement infrastructure as code with Terraform
